===========

A small [Sketch 3](http://bohemiancoding.com/sketch/) plugin that takes the currently selected layers and copies them once or multiple times in a specified direction. A must have tool for any UI/UX designer who uses Sketch on a daily basis! :)

## Install with Sketch Runner
With Sketch Runner, just go to the `install` command and search for `duplicator`. Runner allows you to manage plugins and do much more to speed up your workflow in Sketch. [Download Runner here](http://www.sketchrunner.com).
